        <h4>

            >I heard this changes the signature threshold for ballot measures.
            Can you explain that?</strong

        </h4>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            Currently, signature thresholds are based on the turnout for the
            Mayoral race, doubling turnout for the Mayoral race would double the
            signature threshold needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the signature threshold was adjusted to be 2% of the number of
            registered voters, intending for about the same number threshold.
          </p>
          <p>
            A percentage of registered voters being the base for signature
            thresholds makes more democratic sense than counting on low Mayoral
            race voter turnout.

        </h4>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            We should be maximizing the number of people voting for these bonds
            and measures for them to be truly democratic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Popular measures will pass more easily with a broad voter base
            participating in the election. Off-cycle elections can favor
            big-money interests since funding simply goes to a get-out-the-vote
            effort for specific groups to show up for the vote.

          <strong>Will this give another year to the Mayor?</strong>
        </h4>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            Next year, 2023, the election for Mayor, Sheriff, District Attorney,
            City Attorney, and Treasurer will be rescheduled to 2024, giving
            these offices another year before the 2024 election.
          </p>
          <p>
            By not having these elections in 2023 the City Controller estimated
            about $7 million in savings for next year and we don’t have to add
            another election to our schedule for 2023.

            >San Francisco generally has high voter engagement. Will this

        <div class="card">
          <p>
            San Francisco turnout is dismal on odd-year elections. 43% of voters
            on average in odd-years for the local Mayor, Sheriff, District
            Attorney, City Attorney, and Treasurer race versus double — 80% in
            presidential year election cycles.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a citywide turnout of 41% of registered voters in November
            2019 and 86% in November 2020. In 2020, 79% San Francisco youth
            under age 24 voted versus only 21% in 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have an opportunity to double — and in the case of the youth
            quadruple — the number of people showing up to vote for important
            officials in San Francisco by simply moving these elections to
            presidential year cycles.

        <h4>
          <strong
            >Won’t this make an already long presidential ballot even
            longer?</strong

        </h4>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            This will make the presidential ballot longer, but the tradeoff is
            that it would ensure the most powerful people in the City are being
            elected when voters actually show up to vote.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most people in SF know how they are voting for president, VP, etc—
            but we are currently missing their voices for the local offices of
            Mayor, Sheriff, District Attorney, City Attorney, and Treasurer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020 local propositions at the end of the presidential year
            ballot saw 6-7% loss in voter participation due to undervoting— so
            it would take at least 8-10 times as many undervotes as
            end-of-ballot local props to even compare to the lack of
            participation we are seeing in odd-year elections.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want inspiring and exciting candidates for these local races that
            voters will not skip on after they are able to make it to the
            ballot.

            Supervisor Dean Preston put the SF Voter Participation Act on the

            Safai, and Melgar— so it's broadly supported by progressive and
            moderate SF supervisors.

            Endorsements were led by good government, non-partisan voting rights
