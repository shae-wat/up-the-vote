          The measure changes HOW the signature threshold is calculated, but
          leaves the number of signatures required almost exactly the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, signature thresholds to qualify a citizen initiative are 5%
          of the turnout for the last Mayoral race. Doubling turnout for the
          Mayoral race would double the signature threshold needed to qualify a
          citizen initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wanted to make sure it is no easier or harder to qualify a measure
          for the ballot, so the signature threshold was

            >adjusted to be 2% of the number of total registered voters</a
          >, rather than counting on the low turnout for the mayor’s race. This
          results in about the same number of signatures to qualify a ballot
          measure.

          Popular measures will pass more easily with a broad voter base
          participating in the election. Off-cycle elections can favor big-money
          interests since funding simply goes to a get-out-the-vote effort for
          specific groups to show up for the vote.
