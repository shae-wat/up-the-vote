Prop H has the potential to double voter participation in San Francisco for important local offices and save the city millions of dollars.

At a time when voting rights and democracy are under attack, Prop H is a simple solution to ensure that more San Franciscans have a voice in our democracy.

This non-partisan, good government measure moves the elections for Mayor, Sheriff, District Attorney, City Attorney, and Treasurer— currently in odd years— to even years.

Yes on H updates the city Charter to align with a state law prohibiting cities from holding off-cycle elections if doing so significantly lowers voter turnout. Already 50+ cities have made this change in California, including Los Angeles, San Bruno, Modesto, and San Mateo. It’s time for San Francisco to codify the democratic ideals of our state and city!

Over the last decade, voter turnout in San Francisco has averaged 43% in odd year elections and 80% in presidential cycles; with the lowest odd-year voter participation amongst communities of color, the working class, and young voters. Prop H isn’t just about increasing voter turnout but also ensuring that more voters will have a say in city elections.

Consolidating next year’s election into the 2024 ballot will save about $7 million dollars which can be spent instead on urgent needs such as homelessness, housing, and public safety.

Can you imagine what our local elections would look like if more voters participated? It's time to join the other California cities who have already made this important change to increase voter participation.
